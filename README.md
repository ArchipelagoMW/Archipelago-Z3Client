# Archipelago-Z3Client
A Z3 client designed to replace the old Python Z3 client in the Archipelgo MultiWorld ecosystem. This is a Node.js program, and uses Electron.

I am writing this using the latest version of Node.js (currently v16.3.0), but you might be able to get away with using the current LTS version.

### Run it from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LegendaryLinux/Archipelago-Z3Client
cd Archipelago-Z3Client
npm install
electron-rebuild
electron .
```
